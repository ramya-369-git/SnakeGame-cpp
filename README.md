# Snake Game in C++ using Raylib

This is a classic **Snake Game** implemented in **C++** using the **Raylib** library. The game features simple graphics and dynamic gameplay where you control a snake, collect food, and avoid collisions with the snake's own body or the edges of the screen.

## Features.

- Classic Snake game mechanics.
- Snake grows in size as it eats food.
- Random food generation.
- Collision detection with edges and the snake's own body.
- Simple and clean 2D graphics using Raylib.
- Scoring system based on the number of food items eaten.

## Requirements.

To run this project, you need the following:

- **C++ compiler** (Visual Studio, GCC, etc.)
- **Raylib library** (for graphics and game development)
- ### 3. Build and Run
- Open the project in Visual Studio.
- Make sure Raylib is linked correctly in your project settings.
- Build and run the project.

### 4. Controls
- **Arrow keys**: Move the snake.
  - **Up**: Move up.
  - **Down**: Move down.
  - **Left**: Move left.
  - **Right**: Move right.

### How It Works
- The snake moves continuously in the direction specified by the player using the arrow keys.
- When the snake collides with the food, it grows in length, and the score increases.
- If the snake hits the wall or its own body, the game resets.


### Acknowledgements
- **Raylib**: A simple and easy-to-use library for game development in C.
- **Visual Studio**: Used for building and running the project on Windows.
